MiniMax H3 RefMods -- Wan2GP plugin.

No-training "reference mods" for MiniMax H3 Ref2VA: compress an image/video
reference into a small .safetensors file once (Extract tab), then reuse it at
any strength in later generations without re-encoding it every time (Generate
tab), optionally blending several mods together. Ported from the ComfyUI
custom-node pack ComfyUI-MiniMaxH3Mod (MIT, (c) 2026 Luisa/luisacaotica) --
see README.md for how the mechanism works and its current limitations.

Design note on why this plugin has its own "Generate" section instead of
hooking the main Media Generator form: the per-model "Custom Settings" fields
Wan2GP auto-builds from a model's definition (the channel this plugin uses to
carry a RefMod selection all the way to the pipeline) are not given a stable
elem_id, so a plugin cannot bind its own rich widgets to them. Submitting a
self-contained task through the API session (the same mechanism the bundled
Sample Plugin demonstrates) sidesteps that limitation entirely and is the
supported, documented way for a plugin to drive a full generation.

The Generate panel below covers the fields most people tune day to day
(prompt, resolution, frame count, steps, flow shift, sampler, reference-image
budget, LoRAs, step-skipping accelerators, sliding window, and the sol-attn
sparsity dial) plus the RefMods themselves. Anything not exposed here still
gets a valid value: "Sync from the main form" copies every setting from
Wan2GP's own Media Generator tab (for the same model) as the starting point,
and `api_session.merge_settings_with_defaults(...)` fills in the rest from
that model's own factory defaults before submission -- so no field is ever
missing, even ones this panel doesn't have a dedicated widget for.
